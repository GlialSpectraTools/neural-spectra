## Deposited codes for 1/f e vs i glioma manuscript

This repository contains deposited codes for aperiodic 1/f e vs i glioma manuscript. All scripts are functional and organized by analytical domain.

## Repository Structure

- `RestingState/`  
  Scripts for preprocessing and analyzing resting-state electrophysiology data, including power spectral density (PSD) calculation and 1/f aperiodic slope extraction.

- `LanguageTask/`  
  Scripts for analyzing task-based data from a picture naming and auditory naming paradigm. Includes trial parsing, event-related PSD computation, and slope extraction for correct vs. incorrect trials.

- `Anesthesia/`  
  Scripts for pharmacokinetic modeling of anesthetic agents, including propofol and dexmedetomidine. 

- `snRNA/`  
  Tools for integrating single-nucleus RNA sequencing data with electrophysiological metrics. Includes modules for Seurat-based preprocessing, cluster annotation, module scoring, and correlation with nearest-neighbor electrode slopes.

## Requirements
